### Plant Disease Detection using YOLOv5

I manually selected 4 types of plant diseases: Downy Mildew, Powdery Mildew, Iron Deficiency and Anthraracnose to be detected through computer vision.   

Images are annotated using [Classifai](https://github.com/CertifaiAI/classifai) and being preprocessed using [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com/).   

I uses YOLOv5 as pretrained model since it is one of the fastest and higher accuracy model.   

Here are the augmentated data:
